"repositories": A list of repositories from which the required packages can be installed.
"require": A list of the project's dependencies. This includes necessary configurations, modules, themes, and libraries for the project to function. It also includes some modules and libraries that are still unstable.
"require-dev": Dependencies necessary for developing the project but not necessary for its execution.
"conflict": A list of packages that conflict with the project.
